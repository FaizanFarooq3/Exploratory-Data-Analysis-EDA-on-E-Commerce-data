# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on E-Commerce Data

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the E-Commerce dataset obtained from a UK-based online retail store. The analysis aims to uncover interesting patterns in customer behavior and transaction trends over time.

## Problem Statement
The analysis seeks to address the following key questions:
- Which customers place the most orders, and which countries generate the highest revenue?
- How do order volumes and revenue vary across different months, days, and times?
- Are there any specific trends or anomalies in the dataset that could inform business strategies?

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle E-Commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data)
- **Company:** UK-based and registered non-store online retail
- **Products:** Mainly all-occasion gifts
- **Customers:** Mostly wholesalers (local or international)
- **Transactions Period:** 1st Dec 2010 - 9th Dec 2011 (One year)
- **Size:** 541,909 transactions

## Methodology
The analysis involves the following steps:
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and filtering irrelevant data.
2. Data Exploration: Analyzing the distribution of transactions over time and across different customer segments.
3. Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations to highlight key patterns and trends.
4. Insights Extraction: Summarizing the findings into actionable insights.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Results and Insights

### 1. Customer Order and Spending Patterns

- **Thursday** is the most active day for transactions, with order volumes peaking on this day.


### 5. Hourly Sales Patterns

- Most customers likely make purchases during their lunch hour, between **12:00 PM and 2:00 PM**.

### 6. Free Item Distribution
